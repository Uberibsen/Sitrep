# Sitrep - A Foxhole Discord bot
This project is a Discord bot providing status updates on the ongoing war within the game Foxhole.

[Foxhole](https://www.foxholegame.com/) is a massively multiplayer game where you will work with hundreds of players to shape the outcome of a persistent online war. The bot is developed with the [War API](https://github.com/clapfoot/warapi), and fetches data via the API every time the user initiates the bot with pre-written commands

*This project is in heavy development and features are subject to change.*
## Roadmap
According to plan, the bot will have the following features:
- Overall war report
  - Casualties on both sides
  - War duration and outcome
- Individual Hex information
- Latest 24 hours
  - List of recent objectives captured/lost

If the project receives sufficient support and engagement, features that could be included are as follows:
- Prior wars outcomes
  - Total casualties, victors, etc.
- Majority control of key objectives
  - Number of factories, refineries, etc. that each side holds.

## Availablity
While in development, the bot will only be available in one specific Discord server. If you wish to join development or simply try out Foxhole, consider joining my Discord ['Colonial Support Regiment'](https://discord.gg/BHnZrqp4J2). We are a supportive regiment focusing on assisting other major regiments with manpower, materials, etc to support the war effort.

When the bot is deemed stable and developed, the goal is to make it public for others to use.
